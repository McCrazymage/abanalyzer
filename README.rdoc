= ABAnalyzer

ABAnalyzer is a Ruby library that will perform testing to determine if there is a statistical difference in categorical data (typically called an A/B Test).

== Installation
Simply run:
  gem install abanalyzer

== Basic Usage
The simplest test (which uses a gtest):

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'abanalyzer'
  
  values = {}
  values[:agroup] = { :opened => 100, :unopened => 300 }
  values[:bgroup] = { :opened => 50, :unopened => 350 }

  tester = ABAnalyzer::ABTest.new values
  # Are the two different?  Returns true or false (at 0.05 level of significance)
  puts tester.different?


== Multiple Categories
You can use the ABAnalyzer module to test for differences in more than two categories.  For instance, to test accross three:

  require 'rubygems'
  require 'abanalyzer'
  
  values = {}
  values[:agroup] = { :male => 200, :female => 250 }
  values[:bgroup] = { :male => 150, :female => 300}
  values[:cgroup] = { :male => 50, :female => 50 }

  tester = ABAnalyzer::ABTest.new values
  # Are the two different?  Returns true or false (at 0.05 level of significance)
  puts tester.different?


== Tests Available
You can get the actual p-value for either a Chi-Square test for independence or a G-Test for independence.

  ...
  tester = ABAnalyzer::ABTest.new values
  puts tester.chisquare_p
  puts tester.gtest_p


== Running Tests
Testing can be run by using:
  rake test
